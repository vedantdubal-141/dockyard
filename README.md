# dockyard# DockForge

A small DevOps experiment focused on **automating application environments using Docker**.

Clone the repository, run one command, and the application environment prepares itself.

No manual dependency hunting.
No repeated setup steps.

## Overview

Modern applications often depend on multiple tools, services, and runtime environments.
Manually preparing these environments can be slow and inconsistent across systems.

DockForge explores a simple automation approach where a setup script prepares the runtime environment and launches the application inside a container.

Instead of repeating environment setup steps manually, the system automates them to create **reproducible development environments**.

## Basic Idea

```text
clone repository
      │
      ▼
run setup command
      │
      ▼
environment prepared
      │
      ▼
container built
      │
      ▼
application running
```

The goal is not to build a complete platform, but to demonstrate how infrastructure-style automation can simplify environment setup.

## Architecture

The system focuses on automating environment setup and container deployment.

```text
User
 │
 │ run setup command
 ▼
Setup Script (Discovery Engine)
 │
 ├─ checks environment (Auto-installs Docker if missing! 🛠️)
 ├─ 📡 Auto-discovers apps in /app/ and /dockerfiles/
 ├─ prepares dependencies & Just-In-Time secrets
 ├─ builds Docker image
 └─ starts container (with Ctrl+C auto-disassembly 🛡️)
        │
        ▼
Docker Engine
        │
        ▼
Application Container
```

## GitHub Actions Integration (Point 3)

DockForge includes a built-in Cloud Inspector (CI) to ensure your Blueprints are always valid.

### 1. Automatic Validation
Once you fork this repository, any change you `commit` and `push` to GitHub will automatically trigger the **DockForge CI** robot. It will attempt to build your Dockerfiles in a clean cloud environment to verify there are no errors.

### 2. Customizing the CI
If you add a new application, you must tell the CI robot to inspect it.
*   **File to edit:** `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`
*   **What to change:** Add your new app name to the `blueprint` matrix:
    ```yaml
    strategy:
      matrix:
        blueprint: [atsea-shop, rust-dashboard, your-new-app]
    ```

## Extending DockForge (Point 4)

You can use DockForge to automate any application environment with **Zero Manual Updates**.

### Small Tutorial: Running the Forge
1.  **Clone & Enter:** `git clone <repo-url> && cd fake-thon`
2.  **Run:** `sudo ./scripts/deploy.sh`
3.  **Interact:** Select a blueprint from the **Auto-Discover Menu**.
4.  **Wait:** DockForge will check your RAM, generate SSL certs, build the app, and wait for health validation.
5.  **Shutdown:** Press **Ctrl+C** to trigger the emergency disassembly and clean up your station.

### Adding Your Own App (Zero Config)
To add a new application to the engine:
1.  **Source Code:** Move your app source code into a new folder under `app/` (e.g., `app/my-web-app`).
2.  **Blueprint:** Create a Dockerfile in `dockerfiles/` named `my-web-app.Dockerfile`.
3.  **Launch:** That's it! Run the script, and `my-web-app` will be automatically detected and listed.
